    "The `seasonal=13` parameter in the STL decomposition specifies the length of the seasonal cycle in the data. Here's why it is set to 13 in this use case and how to determine it for other cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why `seasonal=13` for AirPassengers?**\n",
    "1. **Monthly Data**: The AirPassengers dataset contains monthly data over several years.\n",
    "2. **Yearly Seasonality**: The dataset exhibits a clear yearly seasonal pattern, meaning the data repeats its cycle every 12 months.\n",
    "3. **Odd Window Size**: STL requires an odd number for the seasonal smoothing window. Since 12 (the number of months in a year) is even, we use 13 as the closest odd number to capture the yearly seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Determine the Seasonal Value for Other Use Cases**\n",
    "1. **Understand the Data Frequency**:\n",
    "   - If the data is **daily**, consider whether there are weekly, monthly, or yearly patterns.\n",
    "   - If the data is **hourly**, consider daily or weekly cycles.\n",
    "   - If the data is **monthly**, look for yearly patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify the Seasonal Cycle**:\n",
    "   - Look for repeating patterns in the data. For example:\n",
    "     - Weekly patterns in daily data → `seasonal=7`.\n",
    "     - Yearly patterns in monthly data → `seasonal=13` (or another odd number close to 12).\n",
    "   - Use domain knowledge or exploratory data analysis (e.g., visualizing the data) to identify cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose an Odd Number**:\n",
    "   - STL requires an odd number for the seasonal smoothing window. If the cycle length is even, choose the nearest odd number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Experiment and Validate**:\n",
    "   - If unsure, try different values for the `seasonal` parameter and evaluate the decomposition results. Look for smooth seasonal and trend components with minimal residual noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Adjustments**:\n",
    "- **Daily Data with Weekly Seasonality**: Use `seasonal=7`.\n",
    "- **Hourly Data with Daily Seasonality**: Use `seasonal=25` (close to 24 hours).\n",
    "- **Quarterly Data with Yearly Seasonality**: Use `seasonal=5` (close to 4 quarters).\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the data's frequency and patterns, you can determine the appropriate `seasonal` value for STL decomposition."
